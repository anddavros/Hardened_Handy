# Tauri Version Resolution Summary

## Critical Finding
There is **no Tauri 2.0.x stable release series**. Tauri versioning went:
- 2.0.0-rc.x (release candidates)
- 2.0.0-beta.x (beta versions)
- Then jumped directly to 2.1.0 stable

## Current State After Investigation

### JavaScript Side (package.json)
Successfully aligned to 2.0.x versions where available:
- `@tauri-apps/api`: 2.0.3
- `@tauri-apps/cli`: 2.0.4
- All plugins: 2.0.x versions installed successfully
- **Note**: `single-instance` plugin has no npm package (backend-only)

### Rust Side (Cargo.toml)
Currently attempting to use non-existent versions:
- `tauri = "=2.0.8"` - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- Earliest stable Tauri 2.x is **2.1.0**

## Recommended Resolution

### Option A: Use Earliest Stable (2.1.0) - RECOMMENDED
```toml
# Cargo.toml
tauri = "=2.1.0"
tauri-build = "=2.1.0"
# Plugins at their 2.0.x versions should be compatible
```

**Pros:**
- First stable release after RC
- Well-tested and documented
- Plugin compatibility verified

**Cons:**
- Slight version mismatch with JS (2.0.x vs 2.1.x)
- May have minor API differences

### Option B: Use Release Candidate
```toml
# Cargo.toml
tauri = "2.0.0-rc.17"
tauri-build = "2.0.0-rc.6"
```

**Pros:**
- Matches 2.0 version in JS
- API compatibility

**Cons:**
- Using pre-release in production
- Potential stability issues
- Security updates uncertain

### Option C: Align Everything to 2.1.x
Update both Rust and JavaScript to use 2.1.x:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
tauri = "=2.1.0"
```

```json
// package.json
"@tauri-apps/api": "~2.1.0",
"@tauri-apps/cli": "~2.1.0"
```

**Pros:**
- Perfect version alignment
- Stable release
- Clear upgrade path

**Cons:**
- Requires updating all JS packages too
- More changes needed

## Decision Made

Given that:
1. No stable 2.0.x exists in Rust ecosystem
2. JavaScript packages at 2.0.x are stable
3. API compatibility between 2.0.x and 2.1.x is high

**Going with Option A**: Use Tauri 2.1.0 in Rust with existing 2.0.x JavaScript packages.

## Implementation Status

✅ JavaScript dependencies installed at 2.0.x
✅ Package.json aligned (removed non-existent single-instance)
⚠️  Cargo.toml needs update to 2.1.0 (currently has invalid 2.0.8)
⏳ Rust dependencies need cargo update after version fix

## Next Steps

1. Update Cargo.toml to use tauri 2.1.0
2. Run cargo update to resolve dependencies
3. Test build to ensure compatibility
4. Document any API adjustments needed

## Version Compatibility Notes

The minor version difference (2.0.x JS vs 2.1.x Rust) should not cause issues because:
- Tauri maintains backward compatibility in minor versions
- The JS API is a thin wrapper over IPC calls
- Core functionality remains consistent

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Basic functionality (recording, transcription, settings)
- **Medium Risk**: Plugin interactions (may need minor adjustments)
- **Watch**: Auto-updater functionality (most version-sensitive)
